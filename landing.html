Simply put, feminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploita-
tion, and oppression. This was a definition of feminism I offered in

Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center more than 10 years ago. It was
my hope at the time that it would become a common definition
everyone would use. I liked this definition because it did not imply
that men were the enemy. By naming sexism as the problem it went
directly to the heart of the matter. Practically, it is a definition which
implies that all sexist thinking and action is the problem, whether
those who perpetuate it are female or male, child or adult. It is also

broad enough to include an understanding of systemic institutional-
ized sexism. As a definition it is open-ended. To understand femi-
nism it implies one has to necessarily understand sexism.

As all advocates of feminist politics know, most people do not
understand sexism, or if they do, they think it is not a problem.
Masses of people think that feminism is always and only about
women seeking to be equal to men. And a huge majority of these

folks think feminism is anti-male. Their misunderstanding of femi-
nist politics reflects the reality that most folks learn about feminism

from patriarchal mass media. The feminism they hear about the
most is portrayed by women who are primarily committed to gender
equality
